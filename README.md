This is a simple experiment with Tensorflow and Keras, on creating a deep learning model with multi-class classification with neural networks.

The data is fake, and generated by an arbitrary non-obvious set of rules with random variables, representing 'symptoms' of patients. Each patient has a severity rating regarding symptoms such as headache, nausea, lack of appetite etc., with fever being in fahrenheit range (96-107). 

The number of nodes and layers in the middle which approximates whether the symptoms determine one of three categories was approximated through research and trial and error. The three potential classes essentially represent "unlikely", "possible" or "likely" to have a certain virus. 

Training data involves 2000 records, and testing data involves 1000. This was also modified and varied to achieve best fit.

The synthetic_data_maker file creates this data, and the model is developed and fit in cov_pred_model_dev. The cov_model_test file runs the model on the part of the data not used for training or testing.

The model overall returns an average of 92% accuracy when running, with an observed range between 90-93%. 

The saved_model file is included in the cov_pred_model/ folder.
